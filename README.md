# Hotel-Management-System-MIS
## Project Overview:

The Hotel Management System is a Java-based application developed using Java Swing and SQL for database management. The system facilitates hotel operations such as customer registration, room management (add/remove rooms), and tracking of other hotel services. The project aims to provide a complete solution for managing day-to-day activities of a hotel, enhancing operational efficiency and user experience.

## Key Features
- **Customer Registration: Allows the addition and management of customer details.**
- **Room Management: Enables the addition, removal, and tracking of room availability.**
- **Booking Management: Tracks customer bookings, check-ins, and check-outs.**
- **Database Management: Uses SQL for maintaining records of customers, rooms, and bookings.**
- **User Interface: Developed with Java Swing for a user-friendly experience.**
  
## Technologies Used
- **Java: Core programming language for the system's logic.**
- **Swing: Used for building the graphical user interface (GUI).**
- **SQL: For database management and data retrieval.**
- **JDBC: Java Database Connectivity for interaction with SQL databases.**

## System Requirements
- **Java JDK 8 or later installed.**
- **SQL Database for storing customer and booking information (e.g., MySQL, SQLite).**

## Setup and Installation
**1.** Clone the repository or download the project files.

**2.** Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

**3.** Set up the database connection and ensure the required tables (Customer, Room, Booking) are created in your SQL database.

**4.** Run the application and interact with the user interface to manage hotel operations.

## How It Works
- **Customer Registration: Enter customer details like name, contact, and ID for registration. This information is stored in the database.**
- **Room Management: Admin can add or remove rooms and view the availability status.**
- **Booking Management: Book a room for a customer by entering the booking dates and room type. Check-in and check-out operations are also managed through the system.**

## Project Development Process
- **Developed the system using object-oriented programming principles in Java.**
- **Designed and implemented a relational database schema to manage customer and booking data.**
- **Integrated Java Swing components for the graphical user interface.
- **Ensured a smooth user experience by optimizing the system's flow and functionality.**

## Conclusion
The Hotel Management System simplifies hotel operations by automating customer registration, room management, and bookings. The system is fully functional and designed to meet the needs of small to medium-sized hotels. It serves as a practical example of software development skills, covering both front-end and back-end development.
